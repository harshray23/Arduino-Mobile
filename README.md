This is a GSM-based Mobile Communication System built using an Arduino UNO, a SIM900A GSM module, a 4x4 matrix keypad, and a 16x2 I2C LCD display. Designed as a standalone embedded system project, this module simulates basic mobile phone functionality such as making calls and sending text messages, powered entirely by an Arduino and a GSM network.
It is ideal for learning the fundamentals of telecommunication modules, AT commands, serial communication, and hardware interfacing with microcontrollers.
